              About Autism
            </h2>
            <p>
              Autism is a developmental condition that causes atypical behaviour.<br>
              The condition's severity varies, for some <em>it barely makes a difference</em> and for others it is impossible to live without assistance.
              It is genetic and <em>is not caused by vaccines or any other external factors.</em><br>
            </p>
            
            <h2>
              Asperger's Syndrome
            </h2>
            <p>
              Asperger's syndrome was a term used to describe people with high-functioning Autism, but it was merged with the more broad diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder due to it being a subset of it.<br>
              While the term is still used in conversation today, it is heavily discouraged to use it due to the person who it was named after being a Nazi scientist.
