          About Autism
        </h1>
        <p>
          Autism is a developmental condition that causes atypical behaviour.<br>
          The condition's severity varies, for some <em>it barely makes a difference</em> and for others it is impossible to live without assistance.<br>
          It is genetic and <em>is not caused by vaccines or any other external factors.</em>

          Asperger's Syndrome
        </h2>
        <p>
          Asperger's syndrome was a term used to describe people with high-functioning Autism, but it was merged with the more broad diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder due to it being a subset of it.<br>
          While the term is still used in conversation today, it is very controversial due to the person who it was named after being a Nazi scientist.
